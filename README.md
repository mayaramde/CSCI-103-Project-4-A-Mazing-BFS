# CSCI-103-Project-4-A-Mazing-BFS
Find the shortest path (a) using a breadth-first search. BFS requires we visit all nearer squares before further squares. You keep track of the search by loading you path into a queue (array).

Starting location = S
Ending location = F
Dots in path = .
Shortest Path = *

Accomplished in this program:
- Allocate 2D arrays for maze, visited, and predecessors
- Queue class: Make internal array to be of size = max number of squares
