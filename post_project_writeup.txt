=============================== Prelab ==================================

1. What data structure will you use to remember which cells have
already been added to the queue or not?

: I used a dynamically allocated 2D array called 'visit'. After visting a position, I set the value of it to 1 in the visit array, so I would know later if I had visited that position or not (a.k.a whether I added that position to the queue all ready). Before including a position in the predecessor array, I would use an if statement to check whether that position was set to zero (hadn't beed already added to queue).

2. At what step of the BFS algorithm do you have to mark a cell as visited?

: You set all cells that you check around the current location (curr) to visited and you make sure that cell hasn't already been visited and that it's current value is '.'

=============================== Review ==================================

1. Describe your "mymaze.txt" test file. It should have multiple paths
of different distances. When you ran your program on it, did your program 
behave as expected?

: I made a maze with more than 1 path (7 rows by 7 columns). One of the possible paths was very long and the other was much shorter in order to make a clear disrepancy between which path is the correct one to take. As a result, my program behaved as expected.
